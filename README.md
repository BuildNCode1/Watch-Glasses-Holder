# Watch-Glasses-Holder
This is a project I've needed for a long time. I wear glasses, and usually a watch. The thing is, when I go to sleep, I put them on a small cubicle next to my bed, where they are prone to getting knocked onto the floor. This is a design that integrates an in-model hinge to create a closing case for my glasses, as well as a hook to hang my watch from.
