# Watch-Glasses-Holder
This is a project I've needed for a long time. I wear glasses, and usually a watch. The thing is, when I go to sleep, I put them on a small cubicle next to my bed, where they are prone to getting knocked onto the floor. This design uses several magnets to securely hold the glasses case closed, as well as a hook from which to hang your watch.
You can mount this to your wall using the screws described below.
For this project, you will require:
  - 48 neodymium magnets, 6 mm by 1 mm (These go in the indentations on the surface of the case parts, 2 of each per hole)
  - 5 wood screws, 20 mm by 7 mm

Here is a picture of the real thing:
